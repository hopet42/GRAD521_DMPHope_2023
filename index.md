# Data Description

The data being recorded that is subject to the DMP is of two kinds. The first is the raw data  from the 16 loadcells located on the machine and accelerometers measuring the vibrations taking place as well as the frequency of the motor spinnning. It will be stored at .csv files. The other is the photos of spindles and blades after testing and descriptions of the damage seen on the components. It will also include the data directly before the failure analysied into plots showing the cause of failure.

# Roles and responsibilities

As the person in charge of building the machine I will be tased with instrumentation maintenance, data collection/generation, quality control, DMP implementation, access control, and the big one, software creation. I will share the roles of data analysis, data organization, and software maintenance with the sponsor. As we are building the machine for a company with its own established data organization methods we will not be reinventing the wheel here and will be building our data organization strategy around this. Data collected from the initial tests will be analyzed at OSU to inform software creation and requirement validation to ensure machine does what is expected. The data will also be sent to the sponsor as well to show the machine is meeting the requirements. Once the machine is delivered I will no longer be in charge of software maintenance as the program used was chosen because people at the sponsor know the language and can troubleshoot issues as they arise.  

# Data standards and metadata

All raw data will be stored for future analysis as well as the relavent data will be analysed and saved with the resulting outcome and reports. The date and time as well as any relavent testing information will be stored in the same file location as the test that was ran.

# Storage and security

The data will be stored on the Box drive. As it is testing confermations for a machine little buisness knowlage can be gained from the public release of the data without knowing the background of what and why the machine was build. 

# Access and data sharing

Me, the PI on the project, and the sponsor will be the only ones with direct access to the data. The sponsor will be in charge of sharing data at their own discresion.

# Archiving and preservation

The data will not be archived as once the sponsor accepts the maching and I graduate the project is finished and all tests will be able to be re-created.
