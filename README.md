Data Management Plan for the testing of Lawnmower spindle testing machine.

Context of the project:
This is the data managment plan for a non-commercial lawnmower spindle testing machine. In a typical lawnmower there is a small electric or gas engine connected to a spindle by a belt with a blade on the end of said spindle. This machine is being built to test the spindle over all ranges of testing conditions with the ultimate goal of causing complete failure of said spindle while collecting all relavent data to find ways to improve on the design.
